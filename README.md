# Casino World Test
This is a test developed with mostly CSS, HTML and JS as a WordPress custom theme

## Installation
First of all I used a WAMP server in order to run it, created a localhost and installed WP in the www folder of wampserver. 
```bash
E.g ( C:\wamp64\www\project_goes_here )
```
In order to get the SCSS running I installed gulp, so when you open the project run gulp in terminal after installing npm.
```bash
npm install 
gulp
```
The password of admin is _(dKCf4B#WDFHYZTQZXO)_ and username is _(admin)_.
